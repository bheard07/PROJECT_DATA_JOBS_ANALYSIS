# Introduction
My first capstone project diving into the data job market using databases from 2023! Focusing on data analyst roles (my interested field), this project explores top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and where high demand meets high salary in data analytics. Database and project details provided by Luke Barousse.

# Background
Utilized as a way to learn more about data analyst jobs and the skills required to become a data analyst. The purpose of the analysis was to find out the top-paid and most in-demand skills in data and streamlining it all to find optimal jobs.

Data source comes from [SQL_Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql).

### The questions I asked for my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying jobs for my role?

2. What are the skills required for these top-paying roles?

3. What are the most in-demand skills for my role?

4. What are the top skills based on salary for my role?

5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I used a few powerful tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone and major tool I primarily used, allowing me to query databases.
- **PostgreSQL:** My chosen database management system,based on data of how popular it is.
- **Visual Studio Code(VS Code):** My main tool for database management and executing the SQL queries.
- **Microsoft Excel:** I used this to paste the results of my queries and show data visualization graphs inside of excel to show the full range of my data analytics skills.
- **Git & GitHub:** Used to pull and share all of my SQL work and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed to investigate specific aspects of the data job market, specifically for me, data analysts. Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs and my local area. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in this field.

### 2. Top Paying Job Skills
To identify the top skills required for the roles I found in the first query. I added to the previous query by including a CTE and cleaned the data to better show skills over job titles.

### 3. Top Paying Jobs for Data
